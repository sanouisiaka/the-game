# BetThemAll - The Ultimate Football Betting Game

Welcome to **BetThemAll**, the ultimate football betting game where you can challenge your friends, earn BetPoints, and climb the leader board to become the GOAT (Greatest of All Time).

## Introduction

BetThemAll is all about betting on football matches from around the world. The riskier the bet, the more points you can earn. The best part? No credit card or real money is required! Just sign in and start predicting match results.

## Structure

The BetThemAll project is a good way for me to share my coding skills, it follows clean code principles, domain-driven development, and a microservices architecture. Currently, the project consists of three microservices:

1. **Backend**
    - The backend is responsible for processing match results and providing an API for authenticated users to perform actions like retrieving rankings or placing bets.
    - [README](/backend/README.md)

2. **DataFetcher**
    - The data fetcher periodically calls an external football API to retrieve essential football data, including teams, leagues, matches, and bets, to enhance the BetThemAll experience.
    - [README](/sport-data-fetcher/README.md)

3. **FrontEnd**
    - The frontend of BetThemAll is built with React, providing a user-friendly interface for bettors to authenticate and navigate through the app with ease.

## Getting Started

Provide concise instructions on how to set up and run the game, including any prerequisites.

## Contributing

I have exciting features planned for BetThemAll, such as chat, live results, and events. I'm committed to keeping the project up to date with best practices and technologies. While I strive for perfection, I'm open to discussing implementation choices.
